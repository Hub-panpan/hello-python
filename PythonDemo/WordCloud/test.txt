With the development of the market economy, competition in the world of business has become more fierce in China. Many businessmen fined it difficult to practice their own personal code of ethics and it is hard to deny the fact that bribery and other questionable payments are on the increase in China. In the past China’s Anti-Corruption Campaign focused only on bribery and corruption in the public sector, but it is now not only targeting officials who receive bribes,but also the business that provide bribes—both to public officials and to other businesses. It is hoped that the expanded scope of of China’s Anti-Corruption Campaign will have a substantial and positive impact on Chinas business investment environment. Actually, bribery in business is common throughout the world : all the countries are seeking solutions to the problem.


   The Tail of Fame
    An artist who seeds fame is like a dog chasing his own tail who, when he captures it , does not know what else to do but to continue chasing it. The cruelty of success is that it often leads those who seek such success to participate in their own destruction.
“Don’t quit your day job!” is advice frequently given by understandably pessimistic family members and friends to a budding artist who is trying hard to succeed . The conquest of fame is difficult at best, and many end up emotionally if not financially bankrupt . Still, impure motives such as the desire for worshipping fans and praise from peers may spur the artist on. The lure of drowning in fame’s imperial glory is not easily resisted.
Those who gain fame most often gain it as a result of exploiting their talent for singing, dancing, painting, or writing, etc. They develop a style that agents market aggressively to hasten popularity, and their ride on the express even got there. Artists cannot remain idle, though. When the performer, painter or writer becomes bored, their work begins to show a lack of continuity in its appeal and it becomes difficult to sustain the attention of the public. After their enthusiasm has dissolved, the public simply moves on to the nest flavor fo the month. Artists who do attempt to remain current by making even minute changes to their style of writing, dancing or singing, run a significant risk of losing the audience’s favor. The public simply discounts styles other than those for which the artist has become famous.
Famous authors’ styles—a Tennessee Williams play or a plot by Ernest Hemingway or a poem by Robert Frost or T.S. Eliot—are easily recognizable. The same is true of painters like Monet, Renoir, or Dali and moviemakers like Hitchcock, Fellini, Spielberg, Chen Kaige or Zhang Yimou. Their distinct styles marked a significant change in form from others and gained them fame and fortune. However, they paid for it by giving up the freedom to express themselves with other styles or forms.
Fame’s spotlight can be hotter than a tropical jungle—a fraud is quickly exposed, and the pressure of so much attention is too much for most to endure. It takes you out of yourself: You must be what the public thinks you are, not what you really are or could be. The performer, like the politician, must often please his or her audiences by saying things he or she does not mean or fully believe.
One drop of fame will likely contaminate the entire well of a man’s soul, and so an artist who remains true to himself of herself is particularly amazing. You would be hard-pressed to underline many names of those who have not compromised and still succeeded in the fame game. An example, the famous Irish writer Oscar Wilde, known for his uncompromising behavior, both social and sexual, to which the public objected, paid heavily for remaining true to himself. The mother of a young man Oscar was intimate with accused him at a banquet in front of his friends and fans of sexually influencing her son. Extremely angered by her remarks, he sued the young man’s mother, asserting that she had damaged his “good” name. He should have hired a better attorney, though. The judge did not second Wilde’s call to have the woman pay for damaging his name, and instead fined Wilde. He ended up in jail after refusing to pay, and even worse, was permanently expelled from the wider circle of public favor. When things were at their worst, he found that no one was willing to risk his or her name in his defense. His price for remaining true to himself was to be left alone when he needed his fans the most.
Curiously enough, it is those who fail that reap the greatest reward: freedom!They enjoy the freedom to express themselves in unique and original ways without fear of losing the support of fans. Failed artists may find comfort had passed away or in knowing that they did not sell out. They may justify their failure by convincing themselves their genius is too sophisticated for contemporary audiences.
Single-minded artists who continue their quest for fame even after failure might also like to know that failure has motivated some famous people to work even harder to succeed. Thomas Wolfe, the American novelist, had his first novel Look Homeward, Angel rejected 39 times before it was finally published. Beethoven overcame the greatest musician in the world. And Pestalozzi, the famous Swiss educator in the 19th century, failed at every job he ever had until he came upon the idea of teaching children and developing the fundamental theories to produce a new form of education. Thomas Edison was thrown out of school in the fourth grade, because he seemed to his teacher to be quite dull. Unfortunately for most people, however, failure is the end of their struggle, not the beginning.
I say to those who desperately seek fame and fortune: good luck. But alas, you may find that it was not what you wanted. The dog who catches his tail discovers that it is only a tail. The person who achieves success often discovers that it does more harm than good. So instead of trying so hard to achieve success, try to be happy with who you are and what you do. Try to do work that you can be proud of. Maybe you won’t be famous in your own lifetime, but you may create better art.

   Charlie Chaplin
He was born a poor area of South London. He wore his mother’s old red stocking cut down for ankle socks. His mother was temporarily declared mad. Dickens might have created Charlie Chaplin’s childhood. But only Charlie Chaplin could have created the great comic character of “the Tramp”, the little man in rags who gave his creator permanent fame.
Other countries—France, Italy, Spain, even Japan—have provided more applause (and profit) where Chaplin is concerned than the land of his birth. Chaplin quit Britain for good in 1913 when he journeyed to America with a group of performers to do his comedy act on the stage, where talent scouts recruited him to work for Mack Sennett, the king of Hollywood comedy films.
Sad to say, many English people in the 1920s and 1930s thought Chaplin’s Tramp a bit, well, “crude”, Certainly middle-class audiences did: the working-class audiences were more likely to clap for a character who revolted against authority, using his wicked little cane to trip it up, or aiming the heel of his boot for a well-placed kick at its broad rear. All the same, Chaplin’s comic beggar didn’t seem all that English or even working-class. English tramps didn’t sport tiny moustaches, huge pants or tail coats: European leaders and Italian waiters wore things like that. Then again, the Tramp’s quick eye for a pretty girl had a coarse way about it that was considered, well, not quite nice by English audiences—that’s how foreigners behaved, wasn’t it ? But for over half of his screen career, Chaplin had no screen voice to confirm his British nationality.
Indeed, it was a headache for Chaplin when he could no longer resist the talking movies and had to find “the right voice” for his Tramp. He postponed that day as long as possible: In Modern Times in 1936, the first film in which he was heard as a singing waiter, he made up a nonsense language which sounded like no known nationality. He later said he imagined the Tramp to be a college-educated gentleman who’d come down in the world. But if he’d been able to speak with an educated accent in those early short comedies, it’s doubtful if he could have achieved world fame. And the English would have been sure to find it “odd” . No one was certain whether Chaplin did it on purpose but this helped to bring about his huge success.
He was an immensely talented man, determined to a degree unusual even in the ranks of Hollywood stars. His huge feme gave him the freedom—and, more importantly, the money—to be his own master. He already had the urge to explore and extend a talent he discovered in himself as he went along. “It can’t be me. Is that possible? How extraordinary” is how he greeted the first sight of himself as the Tramp on the screen.
But that shock roused his imagination. Chaplin didn’t have his jokes written into a script in advance; he was the kind of comic who used his physical senses to invent his art as he went along. Lifeless objects especially helped Chaplin make “contact” with himself as an artist. He turned them into other kind of objects. Thus, a broken alarm clock in the movie The Pawnbroker became a “sick” patient undergoing surgery; boots were boiled in his film The Gold Rush and their soles eaten with salt and pepper like prime cuts of fish (the nails being removed like fish bones). This physical transformation, plus the skill with which he executed it again and again, is surely the secret of Chaplin’s great comedy.
He also had a deep need to be loved—and a corresponding fear of being betrayed. The two were hard to combine and sometimes—as in his early marriages—the collision between them resulted in disaster. Yet even this painfully-bought self-knowledge found its way into his comic creations .The sunset with him; while the other side of Chaplin makes Monsieur Verdoux, the French wife killer, into a symbol of hatred for women.
It’s a relief to know that life eventually gave Charlie Chaplin the stability and happiness it had earlier denied him. In Oona O’Neill Chaplin, he found a partner whose stability and affection spanned the 37 years age difference between them, which had seemed so threatening, that when the official who was marrying them in 1942 turned to the beautiful girl of 17 who’d given notice of their wedding date, he said, “And where is the young man? ”—Chaplin, then 54, had cautiously waited outside. As Oona herself was the child of a large family with its own problems, she was well prepared for the battle that Chaplin’s life became as many unfounded rumors surrounded them both—and, later on, she was the center of calm in the quarrels that Chaplin sometimes sparked in his own large family of talented children.
Chaplin died on Christmas Day 1977. A few months later, a couple of almost comic body thieves stole his body from the family burial chamber and held it for money. The police recovered it with more efficiency than Mack Sennett’s clumsy Keystone Cops would have done, but one can’t help feeling Chaplin would have regarded this strange incident as a fitting memorial—his way of having the last laugh on a world to which he had given so many.

Longing for a New Welfare System
A welfare client is supposed to cheat. Everybody expects it. Faced with sharing a dinner of raw pet food with the cat, many people in wheelchairs I know bleed the system for a few extra dollars. They tell the government that they are getting two hundred dollars less than their real pension so they can get a little extra welfare money. Or, they tell the caseworker that the landlord raised the rent by a hundred dollars.
I have opted to live a life of complete honesty. So instead, I go out and drum up some business and draw cartoons. I even tell welfare  how much I make! Oh, I’m tempted to get paid under the table. But even if I yielded to that temptation, big magazines are not going to get involved in some sticky situation. They keep my records, and that information goes right into the government’s computer. Very high-profile.
As a welfare client I’m expected to bow before the caseworker. Deep down, caseworkers know that they are being made fools of by many of their clients, and they feel they are entitled to have clients bow to them as compensation. I’m not being bitter. Most caseworkers begin as college-educated liberals with high ideals. But after a few years in a system that practically requires people to lie, they become like the one I shall call “Suzanne”, a detective in shorts.
Not long after Christmas last year, Suzanne came to inspect my apartment and saw some new posters pasted on the wall. “Where’d you get the money for those?” she wanted to know.
“Friends and family.”
“Well, you’d better have a receipt for it, by God. You have to report any donations or gifts.”
This was my cue to beg. Instead, I talked back. “I got a cigarette from somebody on the street the other day. Do I have to report that?”
“Well, I’m sorry, but I don’t make the rules, Mr. Callahan.”
Suzanne tries to lecture me about repairs to my wheelchair, which is always breaking down because welfare won’t spend money maintaining it properly. “ You know, Mr. Callahan, I’ve heard that you put a lot more miles on that wheelchair than average.”
Of course I do. I’m an active worker, not a vegetable. I live near downtown, so I can get around in a wheelchair. I wonder what she’d think if she suddenly broke her hip and had to crawl to work.
Government cuts in welfare have resulted in hunger and suffering for a lot of people, not just me. But people with spinal cord injuries felt the cuts in a unique way: The government stopped taking care of our chairs. Each time mine broke down, lost a screw, needed a new roller bearing, the brake wouldn’t work, etc.. And I called Suzanne, I had to endure a little lecture. Finally, she’d say, “Well, if I can find time today, I’ll call the medical worker.”
She was supposed to notify the medical worker, who would certify that there was a problem. Then the medical worker called the wheelchair repair companies to get the cheapest bid. Then the medical worker alerted the main welfare office at the state capital. They considered the matter for days while I lay in bed, unable to move. Finally, if I was lucky, they called back and approved the repair.
When welfare learned I was making money on my cartoons, Suzanne started “visiting” every fortnight instead of every two months. She looked into every corner in search of unreported appliances, or maids, or a roast pig in the oven, or a new helicopter parked out back. She never found anything, but there was always a thick pile of forms to fill out the end of each visit, accounting for every penny.
There is no provision in the law for a gradual shift away welfare. I am an independent businessman, slowly building up my market. It’s impossible to jump off welfare and suddenly be making two thousand dollars a month. But I would love to be able to pay for some of my living and not have to go through an embarrassing situation every time I need a spare part for my wheelchair.
There needs to be a lawyer who can act as a champion for the rights of welfare clients, because the system so easily lends itself to abuse by the welfare givers as well as by the clients. Welfare sent Suzanne to look around in my apartment the other day because the chemist said I was using a larger than usual amount of medical supplies. I was, indeed: The hole that has been surgically cut to drain urine had changed size and the connection to my urine bag was leaking.
While she was taking notes, my phone range and Suzanne answered it. The caller was a state senator, which scared Suzanne a little. Would I sit on the governor’s committee and try to do something about the thousands of welfare clients who, like me, could earn part or all of their own livings if they were allowed to do so, one step at a time?
Hell, yes, I would! Someday people like me will thrive under a new system that will encourage them, not seek to convict them of cheating. They will be free to develop their talents without guilt or fear—or just hold a good, steady job.

The Telecommunications Revolution
A transformation is occurring that should greatly boost living standards in the developing world. Places that until recently were deaf and dumb are rapidly acquiring up-to-date telecommunications that will let them promote both internal and foreign investment. It may take a decade for many countries in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe to improve transportation, power supplies, and other utilities. But a single optical fiber with a diameter of less than half a millimeter can carry more information than a large cable made of copper wires. By installing optical fiber, digital switches, and the latest wireless transmission system, a parade of urban centers and industrial zones from Beijing to Budapest are stepping are stepping directly into the Information Age. A spider’s web of digital and wireless communication links is already reaching most of Asia and parts of Eastern Europe.
All these developing regions see advanced communication as a way to leap over whole stages of economic development. Widespread access to information technologies, for example, promises to condense the time required to change from labor-intensive assembly work to industries that involve engineering, marketing, and design. Modern communication “will give countries like China and Vietnam a huge advantage over countries stuck with old technology”.
How fast these nations should push ahead is a matter of debate. Many experts think Vietnam is going too far by requiring that all mobile phones be expensive digital models, when it is desperate for any phone, period. “These countries lack experience in weighing costs and choosing between technologies,” says one expert.
Still, there’s little dispute that communications will be a key factor separating the winners from the losers. Consider Russia. Because of its strong educational system in mathematics and science, it should thrive in the Information Age. The problem is its national phone system is a rusting antique that dates from the 1930s. To lick this problem, Russia is starting to install optical fiber and has a strategic plan to pump $40 billion into various communications projects. But its economy is stuck in recession and it barely has the money to even scratch the surface of the problem.
Compare that with the mainland of China. Over the next decade, it plans to pour some $100 billion into telecommunications equipment. In a way, China’s backwardness is an advantage, because the expansion occurs just as new technologies are becoming cheaper than copper wire systems. By the end of 1995, each of China’s provincial capitals except for Lhasa will have digital switches and high-capacity optical fiber links. This means that major cities are getting the basic infrastructure to become major parts of the information superhighway, allowing people to log on to the most advanced services available.
Telecommunications is also a key to Shanghai’s dream of becoming a top financial center. To offer peak performance in providing the electronic data and paperless trading global investors expect, Shanghai plans telecommunications networks as powerful as those in Manhattan.
Meanwhile, Hungary also hopes to jump into the modern world. Currently, 700,000 Hungarians are waiting for phones. To partially overcome the problem of funds and to speed the import of Western technology, Hungary sold a 30% stake in its national phone company to two Western companies. To further reduce the waiting list for phones, Hungary has leased rights to a Dutch-Scandinavian group of companies to build and operate what it says will be one of the most advanced digital mobile phone systems in the world.
In fact, wireless is one of the most popular ways to get a phone system up fast in developing countries. It’s cheaper to build radio towers than to string lines across mountain ridges, and businesses eager for reliable service are willing to accept a significantly higher price tag for a wireless call—the fee is typically two to four times as much as for calls made over fixed lines.
Wireless demand and usage have also exploded across the entire width and breadth of Latin America. For wireless phone service providers, nowhere is business better than in Latin America—having an operation there is like having an endless pile of money at your disposal. BellSouth Corporation, with operations in four wireless markets, estimates its annual revenue per average customer at about $2,000 as compared to $860 in the United States. That’s partly because Latin American customers talk two to four times as long on the phone as people in North America.
Thailand is also turning to wireless, as a way to allow Thais to make better use of all the time they spend stuck in traffic. And it isn’t that easy to call or fax from the office: The waiting list for phone lines has from one to two million names on it. So mobile phones have become the rage among businesspeople who can remain in contact despite the traffic jams.
Vietnam is making one of the boldest leaps. Despite a per person income of just $220 a year, all of the 300,000 lines Vietnam plans to add annually will be optical fiber with digital switching, rather than cheaper systems that send electrons over copper wires. By going for next-generation technology now, Vietnamese telecommunications officials say they’ll be able to keep pace with anyone in Asia for decades.
For countries that have lagged behind for so long, the temptation to move ahead in one jump is hard to resist. And despite the mistakes they’ll make, they’ll persist—so that one day they can cruise alongside Americans and Western Europeans on the information superhighway.

Choose bo Be Alone on Purpose
Here we are, all by ourselves, all 22 million of us by recent count, alone in our rooms, some fo us liking it that way and some of us not. Some of us divorced, some widowed, some never yet committed.
Loneliness may be a sort of national disease here, and it’s more embarrassing for us to admit than any other sin. On the other hand, to be alone on purpose, having rejected company rather than been cast out by it, is one characteristic of an American hero. The solitary hunter or explore needs no one as they venture out among the deer and wolves to tame the great wild areas. Thoreau, alone in his cabin on the pond, his back deliberately turned to the town. Now, that’s character for you.
Inspiration in solitude is a major commodity for poets and philosophers. They’re all for it. They all speak highly of themselves for seeking it out, at least for an hour or even two before they hurry home for tea.
Consider Dorothy Wordsworth, for instance, helping her brother William put on his coat, finding his notebook and pencil for him, and waving as he sets forth into the early spring sunlight to look at flowers all by himself. “How graceful, how benign, is solitude,” he wrote.
No doubt about it, solitude is improved by being voluntary.
Look at Milton’s daughters arranging his cushions and blankets before they silently creep away, so he can create poetry. Then, rather than trouble to put it in his own handwriting, he calls the girls to come back and write it down while he dictates.
You may have noticed that most of these artistic types went outdoors to be alone. The indoors was full of loved ones keeping the kettle warm till they came home.
The American high priest of solitude was Thoreau. We admire him, not for his self-reliance, but because he was all by himself out there at Walden Pond, and he wanted to be—all alone in the woods.
Actually, he lived a mile, or 20 minutes’ walk, from his nearest neighbor; half a mile from the railroad; three hundred yards from a busy road. He had company in and out of the hut all day, asking him how he could possibly be so noble. Apparently the main point of his nobility way that he had neither wife nor servants, used his own axe (斧子）to chop his own wood, and washed his own cups and saucers. I don’t know who did his laundry; he doesn’t say, but he certainly dosen’t mention doing his own, either. Listen to him:”I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.”
Thoreau had his own self-importance for company. Perhaps there’s a message here: The larger the ego, the less the need for other egos around. The more modest and humble we feel, the more we suffer from solitude, feeling ourselves inadequate company.
If you live with other people, their temporary absence can be refreshing. Solitude will end on Thursday. If today I use a singular personal pronoun to refer to myself, next week I will use the plural form. While the others are absent you can stretch out your soul until it fills up the whole room, and use your freedom, coming and going as you please without apology, staying up late to read, soaking in the bath, eating a whole pint of ice cream at one sitting, moving at your own pace. Those absent will be back. Their waterproof winter coats are in the closet and the dog keeps watching for them at the window. But when you live alone, the temporary absence of your friends and acquaintances leaves a vacuum; they may never come back.
The condition fo loneliness rises and falls, but the need to talk goes on forever. It’s more basic than needing to listen. Oh, we all have friends we can tell important things to , people we can call to say we lost our job or fell on a slippery floor and broke our arm. It’s the daily succession of small complaints and observations and opinions that backs up and chokes us. We can’t really call a friend to say we got a parcel from our sister, or it’s getting dark earlier now or we don’t trust that new Supreme Court justice.
Scientific surveys show that we who live alone talk at length to ourselves and our pets and the television. We ask the cat whether we should wear the blue suit or the yellow dress. We ask the parrot if we should prepare steak, or noodles, for dinner. We argue with ourselves over who is the greater sportsman: that figure skater or this skier. There’s nothing wrong with this.
It’s good for us, and a lot less embarrassing than the woman in front of us in line at the market who’s telling the cashier that her niece Melissa may be coming to visit on Saturday, and Melissa is very fond of hot chocolate, which is why she bought the powdered hot chocolate mix, though she never drinks it herself.
It’s important to stay rational.
It’s important to stop waiting and settle down and make ourselves comfortable, at least temporarily, and find some grace and pleasure in our condition, not like a self-centered British poet but like a patient princess sealed up in a tower, waiting for the happy ending to our fairy tale.
After all, here we are. It may not be where we expected to be, but for the time being we might as well call it home. Anyway, there is no place like home.

Bribery and Business Ethics 
Students taking business courses are sometimes a little surprised to find that classes on business ethics have been included in their schedule. They often do not realize that bribery in various forms is on the increase in many countries and, in some, has been a way of life for centuries.
Suppose that during a negotiation with some government officials, the Minister of Trade makes it clear to you that if you offer him a substantial bribe, you are also likely to avoid “rocedural delays”, as he puts it. Now, the question is :Do you pay up or stand by your principles?
It is easy to talk about having high moral standards but, in practice, what would one really do in such a situation? Some time ago a British car manufacturer was such as paying agents and purchasers an exaggerated commission, offering additional discounts, and making payments to numbered bank accounts in Switzerland. The company rejected these charges and they were later withdrawn. Nevertheless, at that time, there were people in the motor industry in Britain who were prepared to say in private: “Look, we’re in a very competitive business. Every year we’re selling more than a £1 billion worth of cars abroad. If we spend a few million pounds to keep some of the buyers happy, who’s hurt? If we didn’t do it, someone else would.”
It is difficult to resist the impression that bribery and other questionable payments are on the increase. Indeed, they seem to have become a fact of commercial life. To take just one example, the Chrysler Corporation, the third largest of the US car manufacturers, revealed that it made questionable payments of more than $2.5 million between 1971 and 1976. By announcing this, it joined more than 300 other US companies that had admitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission that they had made payments of one kind or another—bribes, extra discounts, etc.—in recent years. For discussion purposes, we can divide these payments into three broad categories.
The first category consists of substantial payments made for political purposes or to secure major contracts. For example, one US corporation offered a large sum of money in support of a US presidential candidate at a time when the company way under investigation for possible violations of US business laws. This same company, it was revealed, was ready to finance secret US efforts to throw out the government of Chile.
In this category, we may also include large payments made to ruling families or their close advisers in order to secure arms sales or major petroleum or construction contracts. In a court case involving an arms deal with Iran, a witness claimed that £1 million had been paid by a British company to a “negotiator” who helped close a deal for the supply of tanks and other military equipment to that country. Other countries have also been known to put pressure on foreign companies to make donations to party bank accounts.
The second category covers payments made to obtain quicker official approval of some project, to speed up the wheels of government. An interesting example of this kind of payment is provided by the story of a sales manager who had been trying for some months to sell road machinery to the Minister of Works of a Caribbean country. Finally, he hit upon the answer. Discovering that the minister collected rare books, he bought a rare edition of a book, slipped $20,000 within its pages, then presented it to the minister. This man examined its contents, then said, “I understand there is a two-volume edition of this work.” The sales manager, who was quick-witted, replied, “ My company cannot afford a two-volume edition, sir, but we could offer you a copy with a preface!” A short time later, the deal was approved.
The third category involves payments made in countries where it is traditional to pay people to help with the passage of a business deal. Some Middle East countries would be included on this list, as well as certain Asian countries.
Is it possible to devise a code of rules for companies that would prohibit bribery in all its forms? The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) favors a code of conduct that could ban the giving and seeking of bribes. This code would try to distinguish between commissions paid for real services and exaggerated fees that really amount to bribes. A council has been proposed to manage the code.
Unfortunately, opinions differ among members of the ICC concerning how to enforce the code. The British members would like the system to have enough legal power to make companies behave themselves. However, the French delegates think it is the business of governments to make and impose law. The job of a business community like the ICC is to say what is right and wrong, but not to impose anything.
In a well-known British newspaper, a writer argued recently that “ industry is caught in a web of bribery” and that everyone is “on the take”. This is probably an exaggeration. However, today’s businessman, selling in overseas markets, will frequently meet situations where it is difficult to square his business interests with his moral conscience.

Research into Population Genetics
While not exactly a top-telling book, The History and Geography of Human Genes is a remarkable collection of more than 50 years of research in population genetics. It stands as the most extensive survey to date on how humans vary at the level of their genes. The book’s firm conclusion: Once the genes for surface features such as skin color and height are discounted, the “races” are remarkably alike under the skin. The variation among individuals is much greater than the differences among groups. In fact, there is no scientific basis for theories advocating the genetic superiority of any one population over another.
The book, however, is much more than an argument against the latest racially biased theory. The prime mover behind the project, Luca Cavalli-Sforza, a Stanford professor, labored with his colleagues for 16 years to create nothing less than the first genetic map of the world. The book features more than 500maps that show areas of genetic similarity—much as places of equal altitude are shown by the same color on other maps. By measuring how closely current populations are related, the writers trace the routes by which early humans migrated around the earth. Result: the closest thing we have to a global gamily tree.
The information needed to draw that tree is found in human blood：various proteins that serve as markers to reveal a person’s genetic makeup. Using data collected by scientists over decades, the writers assembled profiles of hundreds of thousands of individuals from almost 2,000 groups. And to ensure the populations were “pure”, the study was confined to groups that were in their present locations as of 1492, before the first major movements from Europe began—in effect, a genetic photo of the world when Columbus sailed for American.
Collecting blood, particularly from ancient populations in remote areas, was not always easy. Potential donors were often afraid to cooperate, or had religious concerns. On one occasion, when Cavalli-Sforza was taking blood samples from children in a rural region of Africa, he was confronted him saying, ‘If you take the blood of the children, I’ll take yours.’ He was worried that we might want to do some magic with the blood.”
Despite the difficulties, the scientists made some remarkable discoveries. One of them jumps right off the book’s cover: A color map of the world’s genetic variation has Africa at one end of the range and Australia at the other. Because Australia’s native people and black Africans share such superficial characteristics as skin color and body shape, they were widely assumed to be closely related. But their genes tell a different story. Of all humans, Australians are most distant from the Africans and most closely resemble their neighbors, the southeast Asians. What the eye sees as racial differences—between Europeans and Africans, for example—are mainly a way to adapt to climate as humans move from one continent to another.
The same map, in combination with ancient human bones, confirms that Africa was the birthplace of humanity and thus the starting point of the original human movements. Those findings, plus the great genetic distance between present-day Africans and non-Africans, indicate that the split from the African branch is the oldest on the human family tree.
The genetic maps also shed new light on the origins of populations that have long puzzled scientists. Example: the Khoisan people of southern Africa. Many scientists consider the Khoisan a distinct race of very ancient origin. The unique character of the clicking sounds in their language has persuaded some researchers that the Khoisan people are directly descended from the most primitive human ancestors. But their genes beg to differ. They show that the Khoisan may be a very ancient mix of west Asians and black Africans. A genetic trail visible on the maps shows that the breeding ground for this mixed population probably lies in Ethiopia or the Middle East.
The most distinctive members of the European branch of the human tree are the Basques of France and Spain. They show unusual patterns for several genes, including the highest rate of a rare blood type. Their language is of unknown origin and cannot be placed within any standard classification. And the fact that they live in a region next to famous caves which contain vivid paintings from Europe’s early humans, leads Cavalli-Sforza to the following conclusion: “The Basques are extremely likely to be the most direct relatives of the Cro-Magnon people, among the first modern humans in Europe.” All Europeans are thought to be a mixed population, with 65% Asian and 35% African genes.
In addition to telling us about our origins, genetic information is also the latest raw material of the medical industry, which hopes to use human DNA to build specialized proteins that may have some value as disease-fighting drugs. Activists for native populations fear that the scientists could be used for commercial purposed without adequate payment made to the groups that provide the DNA.
Cavalli-Sforza stresses that his mission is not just scientific but social as well. The study’s ultimate aim, he says, is to “weaken conventional notions of race” that cause racial prejudice. It is a goal that he hopes will be welcomed among native peoples who have long struggled for the same end.

Slavery Gave Me Nothing to Lose
I remember the very day that I became black. Up to my thirteenth year I lived in the little Negro town of Eatonville, Florida. It is exclusively a black town.
The only white people I knew passed through the town going to or coming from Orlando, Florida. The native whites rode in automobiles. The town knew the Southerners and never stopped chewing sugar cane when they passed. But the Northerners were something else again. They were peered at cautiously from behind curtains by the timid. The bold would come outside to watch them go past and got just as much pleasure out fo the tourists as the tourists got out of the village.
The front deck might seem a frightening place for the rest of the town, but it was a front row the rest of me. My favorite place was on top of the gatepost. Not only did I enjoy the show, but I didn’t mind the actors knowing that I liked it. I usually spoke to them in passing. I’d wave at them and when they returned my wave, I would say a few words of greeting. Usually the automobile or the horse paused at this, and after a strange exchange of greetings, I would probably “ go a piece of the way” with them, as we say in farthest Florida, and follow them down the road a bit. If one of my family happened to come to the front of the house in time to see me, of course the conversation would be rudely broken off.
During this period, white people differed from black to me only in that they rode through town and never lived there. They liked to hear me “speak pieces” and sing and wanted to see me dance, and gave me generously of their small silver for doing these things, which seemed strange to me, for I wanted to do them so much that I needed bribing to stop. Only they didn’t know it. The colored people gave no coins. They disapproved of any joyful tendencies in me, but I was their Zora nevertheless. I belonged to them, to the nearby hotels, to the country—everybody’s Zora.
But changes came to the family when I was thirteen, and I was sent to school in Jacksonville. I left Eatonville as Zora. When I got off the riverboat at Jacksonville, she was no more. It seemed that I had suffered a huge change. I was not Zora of Eatonville anymore; I was now a little black girl. I found it out in certain ways. In my heart as well as in the mirror, I became a permanent brown—like the best shoe polish, guaranteed not to rub nor run.
Someone is always at my elbow reminding me that I am the granddaughter of salves. It fails to register depression with me. Slavery is something sixty years in the past. The operation was successful and the patient is doing well, thank you. The terrible war that made me an American instead of a slave said “On the line!”. The period following the Civil War said “Get set!”, and the generation before me said “Go!”. Like a foot race, I am off to a flying start and I must not halt in the middle to look behind and weep. Slavery is the price I paid for civilization, and the choice was not with me. No one on earth ever had a greater chance for glory—the world to be won and nothing to be lost. It is thrilling to think, to know, that for any act of mine, I shall get twice as much praise or twice as much blame. It is quite exciting to hold the center of the national stage, with the audience not knowing whether to laugh or to weep.
I do not always feel colored. Even now I often achieve the unconscious Zora of that small village, Eatonville. F or instance, I can sit in a restaurant with a white person. We enter chatting about any little things that we have in common and the white man would sit calmly in his seat, listening to me with interest.
At certain times I have no race, I am me. But in the main, I feel like a brown bag of mixed items propped up against a wall—against a wall in company with other bags, white, red and yellow. Pour out the contents, and there is discovered a pile fo small things both valuable and worthless. Bits of broken glass, lengths of string, a key to a door long since decayed away, a rusty knife-blade, old shoes saved for a road that never was and never will be, a nail bent under the weight of things too heavy for any nail, a dried flower or two still with a little fragrance. In your hand is the brown bag. On the ground before you is the pile it held—so much like the piles in the other bags, could they be emptied, that all might be combined and mixed in a single heap and the bags refilled without altering the content of any greatly. A bit of colored glass more or less would not matter. Perhaps that is how the Great Stuffer of Bags filled them in the first place—who knows?

Make Euro Disney More European
Dose Mickey Mouse have a beard?
No.
Dose this mean that French men seeking work with the Disney organization must shave off their moustaches too?
It depends.
A labor inspector took the Disney organization to court this week, contending that the company’s dress and appearance code—which bans moustaches, beards, excess weight, short skirts and fancy stockings—offends individual biberty and violates French labor law.
The case is an illustration of some of the delicate cultural issues tlhe company faces as it gets ready to open its theme park 20 miles (32 kilometers) east of Paris in five months’s time.
The Disney management, which is assembling what it calls a “cast” of 12,000 to run the theme park, argues that all the employees, from bottle washers to the president, are similar to actors who have to obey rules about appearance. Anyway, a company spokesman says, no one has yet put his moustache before a job. As one new “cast member” put it : “You must believe in what you are doing, or you would have a terrible time here.”
But what do people think of Euro Disney? People everywhere arej wondering whether Europeans would like this form of American recreation.
For all its concern about foreign cultural invasion and its defense against the pollution of the French language by English words, France’s Socialist government has been untroubled about putting such a huge American symbol on the doorstep of the capital and has been more concerned about its economic effect. It made an extraordinary series of tax and financial concessions to attract the theme park here rather than let it go to sunny Spain.
The theme park itself will be only part of a giant complex of housing, office, and resort developments stretching far into the next century, including movie and television production facilities. As part of its deal with the Disney organization, the government is laying and paying for new highways, an extension fo Paris’s regional express railway and even a direct connection to the high speed TGV railway to the Channel Tunnel. The TGV station is being built in front of the main entrance of Euro Disneyland, and is scheduled to come into service in 1994.
If Euro Disneyland succeeds—theme parks already in France have so far failed—a second and even a third park is likely to be built by the end of the century. Financial expert say that Euro Disneyland, the first phase of which is costing an estimated $3.6 billion, is essential to Disney’s overall fortunes, which have been hit by competition and declining attendance in the United States.
French intellectuals have not found many kind things to say about the project. The kids, however, will probably never notice. Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Peter Pan, and Pinocchio all come from European fairy tales or stories and are as familiar t children here as they are in the United States. To a French child Mickey is French. To an Italian kid he is Italian.
The Disney management is stressing this tradition in an apparent response to suggestions that it is culturally insensitive. Although the concept of the theme park is closely based on the original Magic Kingdom in California and Walt Disney World in Florida, “Euro Disneyland will be unique in a manner appropriate to its European home,” the company says. “The legends and fairy tales which come from Europe figure prominently in the creative development of the theme park.” Officials point out, for example, that Sleeping Beauty’s castle, the central feature of the theme park, is based not on Hollywood, as some might think, but on the illustrations in a medieval European book. Also, a 360-degree movie, based on the adventures of Jules Verne, features well-known European actors.
Asked to describe other aspects of the effort to make the park more European, a spokesman mentioned that direction signs in the theme park will be in French as well as English, and that some performers will chat in French, Spanish and English. “The challenge is telling things people already know—and at the same time making it different,” the spokesman said.
On the other hand, this effort is not being taken too far. Another Disney spokesman said earlier that the aim of the theme park is to provide a basically American experience for those who seek it. In this way, he said, people who might otherwise have contemplated a vacation in the United States will be happy to stay on this side of the Atlantic.
The Disney organization does seem to focus a bit too much on hair. “Main Street, USA”, the heart of Euro Disneyland, it promises, will feature an old time “Harmony Barber Shop” to deal with “messy hair and hairy chins”—and perhaps even offending moustaches. One difference from California or Florida: Parts of Main Street and waiting areas to get into the attractions will be covered over as a concession to Paris’s rainy weather.
Euro Disneyland’s short distance to Paris is a definite attraction. Anyone tiring of American of or fake European culture can reach the Louvre art museum by express railway in less than an hour—from Minnie Mouse to Mona Lisa in a flash.
Communications figured largely in the Disney organization’s decision to site its fourth theme park near Paris. The site is within a two-hour flight of 320 million Europeans. The opening of Eastern Europe is another prize for the company, which thinks that millions of people will put Disneyland at the top of a list of places to visit on their first trip to Western Europe.

How to Cultivate EQ
What is the most valuable contribution employees make to their companies, knowledge or judgment? I say judgment. Knowledge, no matter how broad, is useless until it is applied. And application takes judgment, which involves something of a sixth sense—a high performance of the mind.
This raises interesting questions about the best training for today’s business people. As Daniel Goleman suggests in his new book, Emotional Intelligence, the latest scientific findings seem to indicate that intelligent but inflexible people don’t have the right stuff in an age when the adaptive ability is the key to survival.
In a recent cover story, Time magazine sorted through the current thinking on intelligence and reported, “New brain research suggests that emotions, not IQ, may be the true measure of human intelligence.” The basic significance of the emotional intelligence that Time called “EQ” 	was suggested by management expert Karen Boylston: “Customers are telling businesses, ‘I don’t care if every member of your staff graduated from Harvard. I will take my business and go where I am understood and treated with respect.’”
If the evolutionary pressures of the marketplace are making EQ, not IQ, the hot ticket for business success, it seems likely that individuals will want to know how to cultivate it. I have a modest proposal: Embrace a highly personal practice aimed at improving these four adaptive skills.
Raising consciousness. I think of this as thinking differently on purpose. It’s about noticing what you are feeling and thinking and escaping the conditioned confines of your past. Raise your consciousness by catching yourself in the act of thinking as often as possible. Routinely take note of your emotions and ask if you’re facing facts or avoiding them.
Using imagery. This is what you see Olympic ski racers doing before entering the starting gate. With their eyes closed and bodies swaying, they can do the same by setting aside time each day to dream with passion about what you want to achieve.
Considering and reconsidering events to choose the most creative response to them. When a Greek philosopher said 2,000 years ago that it isn’t events that matter but our opinion of them, this is what he was talking about. Every time something important happens, assign as many interpretations to it as possible, even crazy ones. Then go with the interpretation most supportive of your dreams.
Integrating the perspectives of others. Brain research shows that our view of the world is limited by our genes and the experiences we’ve had. Learning to incorporate the useful perspectives of others is nothing less than a form of enlarging your senses. The next time someone interprets something differently from you—say, a controversial political event—pause to reflect on the role of life experience and consider it a gift of perception.
The force of habit—literally the established wiring of your brain—will pull you away from practicing these skills. Keep at it, however, because they are based on what we’re learning about the mechanism of the mind.
Within the first six months of life the human brain doubles in capacity. It doubles again by age four and then frows rapidly until we reach sexual maturity. The body has about a hundred billion nerve cells, and every experience triggers a brain response that literally shapes our sense. The mind, we now know, is not confined to the brain but is distributed throughout the body’s universe of cells. Yes, we do think with our hearts, brains, muscles, blood and bones.
During a single crucial three-week period during our teenage years, chemical activity int eh brain is cut in half. That done, we are “biologically wired” with what one of the nation’s leading brain researchers calls our own “world view”. He says it is impossible for any two people to see the world exactly alike. So unique is the personal experience that people would understand the world differently.
However, it is not only possible to change your would view, he says, it’s actually easier than overcoming a drug habit. But need a discipline for doing it. Hence, the method recommended here.
No, it’s not a curriculum in the sense that an MBA is. But the latest research seems to imply that without the software of emotional maturity and self-knowledge, the hardware of academic training alone is worth less and less.
